This a live post that I'll update as I continue to explore Clojure. The materials are listed in chronological order. I guess it's evident I prefer taking in a lot of audio-visual content when learning new topics.

* Listened to a lot of [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/) and [Cognicast](http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/) podcasts for the first couple of months, which is how I got into Clojure.
* Watched the [Up and Running with Clojure](http://www.lynda.com/Clojure-tutorials/Up-Running-Clojure/413127-2.html) tutorial on Lynda.
* Watched Chas Emerick’s video on [Starting Clojure](http://cemerick.com/2012/05/02/starting-clojure/).
* Watched Expert to Expert: Rich Hickey and Brian Beckman - [Inside Clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASCH_gPnDw).
* Watched Rich Hickey’s talk: [Clojure, Made Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg).
* Watched [Clojure Koans Walkthrough](http://www.clojurescreencasts.com/koans-walkthrough/01.html).
* Currently reading [Programming Clojure](https://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure) by Stuart Halloway and Aaron Bedra.
