+++

Recently, I tried to figure out unit testing React components. I stumbled upon a couple of good articles by [Simon Smith][simon] and [Marcin Grzywaczewski][marcin]. The former was mainly about shallow rendering and latter went into great depths to flesh out the numerous ways of approaching unit testing React components. Based on the [recommendation][react-discuss] of the React developers, I swallowed the shallow rendering pill.
